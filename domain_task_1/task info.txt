Web Development Task 1
• Your task will be creating a table booking form for a restaurant's website. The form 
should allow customers to reserve a table by selecting the date, time, number of guests, 
and providing their contact information. The form should also include a "submit" button 
that, when clicked, will send the reservation request to the restaurant's management 
team.
• Your task is to create the HTML & CSS for this table booking form. You should ensure 
that the form is user-friendly, easy to navigate, and visually appealing. You can use any 
HTML and CSS techniques you deem necessary to achieve these goals. Additionally, you 
should ensure that the form is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and 
devices.
• Once you have created the HTML & CSS for the table booking form, you should test it 
thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. 
• Finally, you should provide documentation that explains how to use the form and any 
special features or considerations that the restaurant's management team should be 
aware of. This documentation should be clear and easy to understand and should 
include any relevant screenshots or examples.
